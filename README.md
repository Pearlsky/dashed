## Features

There are a bunch of little stuff in it. It fetches data from Github API, there's routing, error boundary, SEO & unsatifactory accessibility.

## Possible Improvements

- The other tabs definitely need some content.
- After the grading I'd probably make it more generic, like, a user inputs a valid github user and it fetches the repos.
- I see room for lots of improvement accessibility-wise; managing focus and active states on the tabbed interface; even better color contrast and stuff;


## Learnings

Too long, won't tell yet.
